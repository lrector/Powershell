I hope you are doing well today. I know you wanted me to keep you in the loop on developments of Beehive in Minnesota…We are starting deployment of Beehive in 3 new cities in MN this month, which we are very excited about. 

Just as a reminder on Beehive, here is a short video  (about 3 minutes) of how Beehive works and our website if you’d like to check it out: www.beehiveindustries.com. 
Also, here is a link to a client who uses our “Public Portal” for their residents to access information: http://grandislandne.map.beehere.net/

I’d love to talk about what is happening in Savage and see if Beehive might be of help to you all. Let me know if/when you’d like to chat.


Thanks!

Hey Mike,

How are things going for you?  Hope all is well.

I ran into Joe a few weeks ago at the NE GIS meeting and he gave me a quick update on Superior, but I figured I would ping you and see how everything is going.  It sounds like you are breaking the town down into quadrants to do the data collection.  Do you know when you are expecting the first quadrant of data to be collected?  I would love to get my hands on that data so we can get that loaded into Beehive and then get it up and running for Larry.

Keep me posted on the timing so I can plan resources here.  I would like to turn this around as quickly as possible once we get the data from you.

Thanks,
Mike

Reporting wastewater (dates & criteria) monthly and stormwater annually (open narrative, but no set metrics defined by the state). Says they're lagging behind on their e-reporting system and ""we need to do something different"". Talked about measuring discharge of phosphorus.  Just spent $15M improving their WW plant (capacity improvements & blow out walls), which was 28 years old.  They've never used grants, but take advantage of bonds when interest rates are competitive. Seems interested in permitting which is currently paper-based - tough to track expirations, which are important to bond enforcement. Subject to annual EPA inspections on thousands of catch basins in the area, and these visits are usually unscheduled. Talked about IBM's presence in the area and their involvement in bringing RO PSI down from 200/300 to 75/85, resulting in a big energy savings and lower maintenance. IBM also got smart meters into homes, and is a huge user of water.  They have 30-50 years of water usage data.  They get their water from Lake Champlain and EJ has 8k residents in 4.6 square miles.

Excellent job by you and your team! This is the most complete summary I have received so far and I like what you are proposing!

We just sent our request to the IT Steering Committee for our Utility and I am waiting to hear back from them.  They usually move at a glacial pace but we have generated enough buzz around the office that we may be able to accelerate the process by other means :)

I will take this and the other two estimates we have received back to our group and get back with you in the next 2 weeks.  Safe to say at this point we will not have an October notice to proceed.  If the start date is bumped back a month or two, would it be safe to assume the completion date could do the same?

Thank you Doug, I appreciate your help and I’ll reach out to Matt for his take on the technical perspective of our software.  

The reason I’d reached out to you though is because you were listed as the Director of Operations for the City’s Sewer.  We’ve designed our tools to help the workers in the field and include modules to assist specifically with Sewer operations.  We’ve had a lot of success working with Municipalities in the Midwest but as we push out into new geographies my suspicion is that there might be nuances and special considerations that need to be accounted for.  You’d know far more about the day to day operations, needs, and challenges of your team than the IT department would so I thought you’d be the best person to ask.

As an example, the following link takes you to a very brief video tour of our Water/Wastewater/Stormwater modules.  It’s very high level and touches on the three different subjects but I’d appreciate any feedback you’d be willing to provide.  We want to be thorough as we continue to build out and improve our tools and having some insight into the local markets would be very helpful.

The city has a 311 line where the public can call in a report issues.  Currently the work flow tracking for these is done manually and takes a long time to get to his people.  He'd like to manage it similar to how their public works does where a ticket is logged and can be accessed in the field on their ipads so the crews can just head out to fix something.  Also he'd like to be able to track where equipment is and who it's checked out to as he'd mentioned having that issue with a new lawnmower and weed whacker.  His budget is being cut for next year so a purchase is probably not likely at this point but he is very interested.  Emailed him overview and some preliminary pricing.  He doesn't want to do a full demo now but if he finds the money he'd like to explore it in the future.

Hi Dan,

It was a pleasure to speak with you this morning, thanks again for your time.  Below is a link which will walk you through a very brief overview of the Beehive system.  As I’d mentioned, this is a generic overview but I think it will give you the gist of our capabilities.  If at some point you’d like to take a more specific dive into our Parks module I’d be happy to set up a web demo for you.

Beehive Overview

I also took the liberty of running some pricing numbers for you just so you have it for future reference.  As I’d mentioned we have a pretty straight forward licensing model so there’s typically not any additional install fee.  For a city like Troy, the Parks Module license would run approximately $5,150 per year.

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback on the overview.","2014-10-15 19:08:21",,32393-contacts,

There are several projects within the city to work on beautifying the parks and public spaces including planting more flowers and native grasses, replace old trash cans, build more restrooms, and even building a new park.  Parks team consists of 5 crews and each has it's assigned area and duties.  One of the teams is ""Odd Jobs"" this group goes around and helps the others as necessary or takes care of one of projects.  Work is primarily assigned verbally or via email as things come in from the public but no good way to track things.  Would love to be able to have a system to log incoming requests and assign out work via mobile.  Also would like to be able to have a repository for asset data and historical records.

He thinks more about Economic growth and politics than the physical workings of the city.  He did share that some concerns for their public works dept include beach maintenance and rebuilding since they are located on an island and rely heavily on tourism.  The city itself is less than 35 years old so much of it's infrastructure is new.  They have a pressurized sewer system which is monitored regularly.  Since the island is sandy they don't usually have much issue with Storm water since it generally soaks right back up but they have made some improvements recently to manage the flow out to a bay when rains are heavy.  They do perform regular inspection of systems, bridges, and streets but wasn't sure how they logged that work.  

Community is engaged through an online help desk and calls are taken at city hall to report issues.  These are then emailed to the various departments and when the issue is handled they get an email back saying it's done.  These all go to a woman named Gladys who then contacts the initial reporter to let them know it was handled.  Talked about providing better accountability to this system through a work ticketing process and taking some of the load off of Gladys' plate but Josh thought the system worked well and didn't think the mayor would support a more automated system because he liked the personalized touch that Gladys provided and didn't think that accountability or communication was an issue.","2014-10-21 14:29:29",,31529-contacts,

Hi Shanda,

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with Mike and me this afternoon.  You’ll find a pricing proposal attached which outlines the cost associated with our Parks module.  

As I’d mentioned on the phone, we take a different approach to pricing than many software solutions out there.  Rather than charging a large up front installation cost and ongoing license fees we provide a flat-fee year to year license model with no additional costs for installation.  The price you pay to license the software in year one, is the same as license costs for year five.  We’re very proud of the fact that we have a 100% annual renewal rate so we’re confident that if you choose to partner with Beehive it will be a long and beneficial relationship.

Let me know if you have any questions on this or any of the information that was shared in our demo today.","2014-10-22 20:00:38",,32437-contacts,

New Milford is today a part of an information technology society.

Right in step, the town's information technology department has grown to reflect the times.

For the last few years, the town's IT director, Kendrick Protzmann, has handled all computer needs for town offices and departments on his own.

Protzmann made a pitch recently at the 2014-15 joint Town Council/Board of Finance budget hearings to have the town hire a network administrator at a $65,000 salary to help with the workload.

""We need a fully qualified person to help administer the network,"" Protzmann said. ""I need someone who can diagnose what's going on if a system is down in a particular department. There are a million different things that could be wrong.""

He explained there are more than a dozen network plans to keep running.

New Munis software has been added for the finance departments of the town and the schools.

The police department is now utilizing just 20 to 25 percent of its new software equipment. Protzmann said he needs to get that up to full capacity.

""I don't think that we can ignore that you need someone to help you,"" said councilwoman Katy Francis. ""We can't expect one person to do all of this.""

Police Chief Shawn Boyne lauded the work Protzmann has done in that department.

""We were brought from 1970 to 2013 in a matter of weeks when we got a professional IT person involved,"" Boyne said. ""We're an information technology society. I can see where we are only going to be asking more of Kendrick.""

The maintenance agreement for the finance department's Munis software would be budgeted at $61,500 for 2014-15.

Total yearly software maintenance agreement and Internet connections for 2014-15 would cost $228,550.

The computer ddepartment budget request would be $386,694.

Mayor Pat Murphy has made no reductions to the request.","2014-10-24 14:29:20",,,

Very proud of how the city has grown and how much they have invested in their parks and public space.  Each park has a crew leader who is responsible for inspection, maintenance, etc and if help is needed a Supervisor or additional crew is called in.  Currently work is dolled out via phone and text to the various crews.  Rick is trying to improve this process by getting mobile phones and using email but he knows it's not perfect.  Talked about what beehive can do and he was very impressed.  The city is currently expanding its parks and public spaces including several miles of bike and walking trails which will connect to surrounding communities.  Rick asked about using reporting and GIS data to benchmark with the other communities.  Currently reporting is very hard to detail and being able to share info and compare with others would be helpful.  Certainly if those other communities are gathering the same type of data (and also using beehive) they could easily compare notes and maintain records on maintenance of those shared trails.  

Gave Rick a quote of 10K for the parks module, he's interested but feels he'd have a hard time getting approval from the Council however, if Public Works got on board he'd have more leverage.  Public Works has been working on projects to provide more efficiency and accountability in tracking work including installing GPS tracking in many of their trucks.  Told him we could help them use that data more effectively.  He's going to talk to ""Sam"" in public works to see if he'd like to sit in on a demo and we'll get back together.","2014-10-24 15:58:24",,35305-contacts,

Thanks for your offer, but I don't think there's anything unique about the public works challenges in Panama City: aging infrastructure, aging workforce, expanding requirements, and static budget.  We are currently using ESRI GIS software to map and track our assets and Facility Dude to track our work requirements and preventative maintenance.  While your software product looks OK, I'm really not interested in in exploring anything new at this time.

The rest (mowing, sidewalks, planting, etc) is handled by Public Works.  If he sees something that needs to be done he tells public works and he has to trust that they'll do it because they don't give him feedback.

As we discussed, I’ll reach back out in about 6 months as you begin to work on budgets.  In the meantime, I’ve included a link that you can visit at your convenience to learn more about our infrastructure management software.  

Also, I know that Edenton is a small town, but given that we work almost exclusively small communities, we are priced much differently than you may have seen.  
•	For example, you could get a W, WW, or Streets module for a cost of $3,000 for the first year and only $2,000/year going forward.  This would allow you to create work histories for specific pieces of infrastructure and take advantage of any GIS data you have, or use ours at no additional charge.  

As I mentioned, I’ll reach out in 6 months, but let me know if you have any questions or would like to take a closer look at the software and how it performs.  

Thanks, again - Brent

They're big Esri users and have Esri's mobile technology and getting ready to roll that out.  His main issue with Esri is that it doesn't support related tables so when info is updated it doesn't feed across.  Also doesn't think that Archpad is great for tracking and logging inspections and can't associate other records like work orders, pictures, videos etc.  They have an enterprise licence so no per-seat cost.

The city is in the process of contracting with City Works which is similar to us in that it can consume the esri data and make it more usable and accessible.  He likes what we have to offer but he prefers city works because the annual cost is low (didn't provide me with upfront costs), it's an onprem solution which he prefers, and it's been around a lot longer than us.  There's a comfort level for him in that he ""knows they'll be around in 15 years"".  He is willing to look at our module videos and provide feedback though and isn't against dropping our name if anyone asks.  He did say that the City of Atchison was recently asking for recommendations on solutions so he'd seen our name on that list.

Stressed the ease of use of the system, discussed pricing and savings in hours and dollars.  They do have arch GIS and currently have a system that they use for work orders but it's more of an accounting solution which is tied to payroll and is more suited to logging actives and devising an average cost to repair something which would be a good tie in.

They are getting ready to start a sewer project and need software like Beehive to assist them.  They also need Code Enforcement. Asked a lot about lap tops for their workers and how that would work.  Brian was intrigued by the time tracking tab.  FEMA reimbursed was brought up by Brian.  Police chief and street superintendent just joined.  Brian has a hard stop at 10:00.  Mike went over the GIS for Greg.  We brought the article with Ozarks that brought GIS alive.  Asking questions about breaking pipe, operational perspective.  Just to new status, history doesn't go away.  Map will behave like a life cycle...react to operational work flow. Brian had to leave, he told Greg to feel comfortable with the system and how it can intergrated into what they are currently using now.  Talking about Code Enforcement.  Code Enforcement is not the same price as the other modules.  $3,600...they like it.  They asked if they can put their violations that can match to their city...answer is yes.  Open violation by age.  They had no questions, they say it looked good.  Keith asked about permission for Brian to see all data in Beehive.  Operational access for Brian.  Short demo/discussion on Roads for Keith and Greg.","2014-11-04 16:16:16",,,

10733-notes,Activities,12525-activities,"Talk-To / Phone Call","Cheryl Schroeder","Spk w/Rachel Urban Dev. Rachel is super chatty and very candid about how the city is run and the issues she sees.  The city is broke and has had to seek grant funding for many of the improvements they've been putting in place.  Most of that funding has gone to streets in low and moderate income areas.  They also have issues with floodplanes and stormwater and have been attempting to get some TIF funding to develop and pave a new area and run water and wastewater which will include some senior living facilities and an industrial park.  

She was very excited about what we do and how we can work with the GIS person and various departments to improve communication and track information across departments.  She feels like there is a lot of ego in play with GIS and public works/water in particular.  When it comes to contractors and permitting there's not a lot of accountability on collecting fees or the work provided so she feels that money is hemorrhaging out of the city.  She also doesn't have the best relationship with the city manager so she's hesitant to bring this project to him herself but her brother in law works in utilities and is the current ""golden boy"" so she'd like to bring this to him to present as an option to the CM.  THere is no PW director at this time.  She asked for information such as our menu of services, video, any suggestions on funding options to pay for it, etc.  She's excited about the prospect but would have to work hard and manage a few different channels to get it off the ground.","2014-11-18 19:13:09",,40849-contacts,

Cheryl,

I've been out of the office much the last couple days.  I didn't realize you originally sent it to the City email address--it auto-forwards to my TSE email.  I wear a few hats down here.  We are contracted as their city engineer and currently filling in for the city planner.

I tried calling once but didn't catch you.  My cell is 918.373.3314.  Feel free to try to catch me next week.  The planning/administrative package is probably what currently interests me most.

For example, just locating valves can be a challenge.  Not a lot of things available digitally, they do have a GIS department (part of IT) who maintains their maps and schematics but requests have to be placed to get information which can take time.  The city currently has City Works but not everyone likes it and they haven't really spent much time exploring it's capabilities because some think it's complicated.

Only projects on the table right now have to do with adding a few lift stations, in general the city has money so they've done a good job keeping up with repairs and replacements of pipes and systems.  They do have a centralized system where they track maintenance/work orders on a GIS basis.  Activities are tied to individual assets such as pipes valves, etc.  Records are maintained by a clerk in the dept, no one else knows how or wants to know how to add that info.  They just bring in a hand written report when an action is taken and hand it off to her to input.  Budget cycle runs june to may and has been approved for next year.  Louisiana does not have a standardized budget cycle for cities some run Jan-Dec others run differently.

He sees a benefit to using a system like ours to create a more data driven environment to make decisions where as now things are very reactionary.

Keep me posted on any dates for submittal, or if the need of setting up a call arises. Have a great Holiday Season, and I hope to catch up again soon!

Hi Heather, Happy Holidays!

I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Zach Stivrins and I am focused on our Pacific Coast clients at Beehive. I had heard the Seal Beach story pop up a few times this summer, so last week I had a call with Sean Crumby. Sean was excited about the combination of Permitting with Asset/Infrastructure Management, and specified that is exactly what the City of Seal Beach is looking to implement. 

Sean gave me instructions to reach out to Luis, so far I haven’t had any luck with the busy holiday timing. If you have further information that may help revive the project or if you have any specifics needs from me at this time I would be more than happy to connect the dots. 

Have a great holiday season, and I wish the best for the City of Seal Beach! I hope to chat soon,","2014-12-16 18:44:16",,13197-accounts,

Hi Zach,

Happy Holidays to you and your crew as well!

On a side note, this jogged my memory a little bit. I am interested in the following modules:

-	Water
-	Wastewater
-	Wastewater Treatment
-	Storm
-	Water Treatment (I noticed that you don’t have a module listed for this. Is this something you have?)

What would the price be assuming that there is no data conversion to worry about? How much, if available, would training be? Would there be a cost difference per module if we phased them in over the next three months or so?

Thanks,

Jason","2014-12-22 19:18:40",,10949-accounts,

Jason, thanks for the rapid reply and the well wishes! The Beehive team is excited to recharge the batteries over the coming weeks and look forward to 2015.

List price for Junction City is $3,600 per module. This is based on a population of 5,600 in the City. We price on population because we have an unlimited user license, also, per your questions, all training is included in this annual license. 

We do have a Water Treatment Module. Which reminds me, I need to update my “Menu”!

Better news still, is that with 4 or more modules we apply a 15% discount across the board. This results in a per module cost of $3,060 for Junction City. Or, with the 5 modules listed below, $15,300/year. 

In regards to your last question, our implementation time frame is 6-weeks. The “phasing” of these rollouts is very common, ie. Wastewater and Wastewater Treatment first, Water and Water Treatment second, followed by Storm, or in any order that takes precedence.  We don’t have a “phased” discount per se due to the 15% discount applied to the contracting of 4+ modules. 

I hope this answers all of your questions! If not, feel free to send another email or give me a call. I would also be happy to schedule a demonstration of the technology so that you can get a better feel for it as you make your decision. I’m sure you and your team have some vacation time upcoming, but let me know how you would like to proceed and I will make it happen.","2015-01-05 23:06:47",,10949-accounts,

According to sherry city works works really well for work orders and everyone's happy with it however, reporting is an issue because it's hard to get information out.  She and the it department are working on creating a backend reporting structure using SQL and crystal reports in hopes of aleviating some of those issues.

Our reporting is already baked in and simple for anyone to use and would give them the reporting capabilities they need.

There are distributors in the region and they just call whenever they need something.  Don't have much for mappng data right now but the previous pw director came out of retirement to help them create some maps with Esri tools.  Guys in field don't use mobile.  Hasn't been asked for reports from council yet (""thank god"") but if he was he admitted he'd have a hard time reporting on it.

One thing that piqued his interest was asset management, one of their contractors has been trying to get them to use a tool that he likes but Jason thinks it's too complicated and hasn't worked for them.  He'd like to be able to track the lifespan, composition, and materials of things like wells, waterlines etc.

Wants to do a demo but isn't sure when he'll have time right now because of some other projects.  Wants to check his schedule and get something on the calendar within the next couple of weeks.  Wants to keep in touch.","2015-01-12 20:15:21",,,

That’s understandable, most smaller cities don’t have a dedicated planner or GIS person on staff.  But then, for what we provide you don’t actually need one.  As part of deployment we’ll take what information you do have (cad drawings, asbuilts, excel files, even the institutional knowledge stored in the heads of city employees) to build out mapping layers for you.  From there it’s a very simple thing to Geoedit pipe placements, add or remove features, etc.

The power of our solution rests in the combination of mapping, asset, and workforce management.  It’s one thing to know where a pipe is, it’s another to know what it’s made of, how old it is, what kind of inspections or repairs have been done to it, and what kind of documentation (reports, videos, pictures) you have on it.  Our goal is to provide a one-stop shop for all of your data so that it’s accessible, reportable, and above all actionable.  If you have a specific section of town where you’re constantly dealing with older pipes bursting, it helps to have concrete data to bring to council if you hope to get funds into the CIP to improve that area.

Let me know if you or the city’s public works director have any questions.  Like I mentioned previously, a high level demo would only take about 30 minutes so there’s not much commitment if you’re curious about what we do.

River Vale - NorthJersey.com NorthJersey.com
MONTVALE — The shared-services agreement with River Vale that dissolved Montvale’s
Department of Public Works was struck down by a state judge Thursday in a finding of violations
of open public meetings rules and a conflict of interest involving the mayor.
But despite that decision, uncertainties continued to resonate Friday: Montvale workers whose
jobs been eliminated plan to show up to work Monday morning, their lawyer said. But Borough
Attorney Philip Boggia said “There is no longer a Montvale DPW” — the borough had taken
preemptive steps to fix violations in knew would be cited, Boggia argued, and the agreement to
share services with River Vale was already in effect.
The case stems from the Montvale Borough Council’s decision in March to hire a consultant to
conduct a feasibility study, and subsequent votes this summer to eliminate the Montvale
Department of Public Works and form the Pascack Valley Department of Public Works with River
Vale, a move explained to the public as a cost-saving measure.
But the five Montvale workers who stood to lose their jobs sued the borough in August, claiming
the council had violated the state’s Open Public Meetings Act — which mandates a certain level of
transparency in the decision-making processes of governing bodies — and had waited months
before telling them that their jobs were being considered for elimination.
The public employees’ suit also claimed that Mayor Roger Fyfe had a conflict of interest: Fyfe’s
brother-in-law was among the first hires at the new DPW. Fyfe neither disclosed the fact, nor did
he recuse himself from discussion of the merger.
In October, Judge Lisa Perez Friscia temporarily blocked the ordinance dissolving the Montvale
DPW, even as the Pascack Valley DPW launched on Nov. 1. For five weeks, four of the five
Montvale workers — one was on disability — received full salaries, but did not actually work. (In
early December, the council voted again to disband the DPW, dropping the workers from the
borough payroll.)
Friscia sided with the plaintiffs, saying the council failed to provide adequate notice of its moves
toward dissolving the DPW. Friscia also ruled that parts of the council’s three closed-session
meetings in May and June should not have been exempt from public hearings.
At those meetings, the mayor and council discussed the consultant’s study, details of a possible
shared-services agreement and possible legal challenges from the DPW, according to borough
minutes including in the ruling.
“It is significant that no contemporaneous public hearings were held, discussing and reviewing the
shared-services study, over the course of five weeks when the three closed sessions were held,”
Friscia wrote.
Friscia further found that Fyfe, who did not vote on the original ordinance but was “intricately
involved” in its execution, breached conflict of interest laws by failing to disclose his brotherin-law’s
involvement in the new DPW, and for not recusing himself during the discussions.

1 of 2 12/29/2013 3:53 PMFriscia concluded that the borough would have to reconsider the shared services agreement from
scratch, and barred Fyfe from participating.
But the borough has in the last month revoted to reaffirm the consultant’s contract, dissolve the
DPW, and join the shared DPW with River Vale — which borough attorney Boggia said the judge’s
decision did not reflect the current situation.
“We already took remedial action,” Boggia said. “No further action by the borough will be taken.
“In anticipation of a decision that was going to find some error or deficiency, the borough had
revoted the resolutions that were required to be adopted, and we also reintroduced and approved
an ordinance dissolving the DPW,” Boggia said.
But William Strasser, who is representing the workers, said the ruling “confirmed” his clients’ case
and invalidates both the dissolution of Montvale’s DPW and creation of the shared services
agreement.
“Under this decision, the DPW workers are still employed by Montvale, and they want to work for
Montvale,” Strasser said Friday.
Friscia’s ruling said the borough was slow to submit its documents for discovery, and, in terms of
the “remedial” action taken. it never submitted transcripts of the meetings at which those actions
were taken. In regard to Montvale’s assertion that its remedial action sufficed, her ruling reads that
“the effective date of the shared service agreement was stayed [in October] until this court’s
decision after final hearing.”
In a letter addressed to Boggia on Friday, a copy of which was provided to The Record, Strasser
accused the borough of being in violation of the judge’s order. “The Plaintiffs will be reporting for
duty on Monday, December 30, 2013 at 7:00 a.m.,” the letter reads. “Please advise as to the
location where you would like Plaintiffs to report.”","2015-01-15 22:34:46",,,

Nick,

Thanks for your time today. It’s good to get some insight on what the city is facing, especially from someone like you who has ‘fresh eyes’ on scene. 

I’ve attached the article from Ozark, MO that discusses how they’ve been able to integrate Beehive with their existing GIS to get more operational use out of it. By making asset history and workforce management available with the mapping, all the city’s data becomes useful, actionable information. I’ve also, attached our “Menu” of modules. As I mentioned on the phone, we have some communities that add Beehive one module at a time, and we are glad to operate that way

Here is a short video that will give you a feel for how Beehive operates. It’s painless at about 3 minutes long. 
Also, feel free to contact Kirk Stocker (308.233.3268 or kstocker@kearneygov.org) to discuss how they have utilized Beehive over the past few years.

Let me know when it works in the schedule in the next week or so to have a 45-60 online demo and we will send a calendar invitation with the instructions for connecting our computers.

Have a great weekend.","2015-01-20 15:28:30",,23053-accounts,

Murat,

Thanks for your time yesterday. It was good to hear what the city is looking for and I’m glad you all are taking a measured careful approach, as this is a big decision for the city.

Do you have a tentative timeframe for when you want to have that matrix complete and a general sense of what the rest of the process will look like? We are glad to wait on the demo, as I think the matrix will be helpful for us to address the specific needs/wants the city has.

If there is anything else I can provide in the interim, please let me know.

Have a good week.

Kevin

Hello Kevin,
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me and answer questions about the Beehive product. As we discussed, Beehive has good features, which may render it beneficial for the City’s needs. We are in the process of developing a software requirements matrix, if you will, which intends to summarize the City’s needs from a CMMS application, including product specifications, legacy information transfer requirements, work flow process requirements etc. We would like to wait until this matrix is complete before scheduling demos with vendors…thanks again…

I realize Ramseur is going through several major personnel changes, which can make any discussion around asset management seem ill-timed.  However, I actually think you would find this to be a perfect time to consider something to help organization all of your information before any more change occurs to help ensure a smooth transition.  As I mentioned on the message, Beehive helps small towns manage their infrastructure assets. Specifically, Beehive helps those towns in three ways:

•	Provides an easy to use work order system that allows tracking and transparency
•	Makes their current GIS more accessible and easier to use for the entire team (or can provide mapping, if necessary)
•	Provides a central location to store documents in various formats, which can be tied to features on a specific point on a map

Further, we specialize in working with smaller communities, so we understand that you have to do more with less, both in terms of employees and money. I am hoping we can have a short conversation so I can learn about the specifics of Ramseur as well as provide you details of how other small towns are using Beehive. Please let me know if you would like to get something on the calendar in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks - Brent","2015-01-23 16:44:08",,59329-contacts,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner, we’ve been getting hammered with snow up here in Lincoln and I was snowed in on Monday and put behind.

I’ve had our Product Manager look over the info you sent me and he agrees that it is a pretty intense process compared to most cities, however, our model is pretty flexible so making a few changes is just a matter of time to implement.  What I might recommend is that we show you where the solution is now as it relates to your outline below.  Then we can scope out any tweaks you’ll need us to make.  From there, we can put together a timeline and quote based on the level of effort.  That should give you a solid idea of whether or not Beehive is something you want to pursue for your team.

I’m going to be in Salina next Thursday (the 12th) to give a broad overview presentation to Public Works and the other department heads.  Keith Ganzenmuller may have forwarded you the invite.  We won’t be covering the Permitting capabilities specifically in this demonstration but you’ll get the gist of the wider solution and we could look at other days/times to focus specifically on your needs.","2015-02-04 19:53:35",,,

I looked at the video of your software today.  I am impressed by the power and ability to organize and keep track of our infrastructure.  Fortunately, the Development Authority of the North Country (DANC) has developed this same ability for all communities along the St. Lawrence River corridor, which includes Massena.  We provided them with the information and they developed a large database of historical information.  We update the data and give to them to manage.  We have not used the system yet but they just made it available two weeks ago.

Obviously, both systems will require an enormous amount of attention however, once information has been attained and input then the level of effort can be reduced.

Unfortunately, I feel your system is somewhat redundant to the system we currently have and share with St. Lawrence County.  It has some added benefits but I do not believe it warrants an investment, at this time.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Communities that want to start with water/wastewater is all well and good but if they want to add streets or storm she doesn't feel like they'd want to spend another 3600 on each, it prices them out of the market.  Might be open to looking at a scenario where we front load dollars.  They have about 20 small cities in their cooperative from 1200 to 20,000 population, but work with up to 50 communities at the moment and looking to add up to 10 more per year.  Also work wit 4 or 5 water/sewer districts.  She's really looking for a solution which can feasibly work accross the board because they don't want to have to deal with multiple asset management systems across all these different communities.  They've looked at all the main players, Lucity, CityWorks, Inforce, Excella.  Wouldn't tell me who the front runner is but said she did find one that worked out to be cheaper over 3-5 years with a per seat model because the vast majority of cities they work with would only need one or two licences.

Was also conserned with the fact that we don't have the mobile app out (explained the difference of mobile with a laptop vs mobile on an IPAD, iPad/android is the only limitation).  Also thought Marty's description of the Esri integration was way more complicated than what other's have provided.  Take a look at creative cost solutions.","2015-03-16 15:52:17",,,

I left you a message a bit ago while you were out of the office, I thought an email might explain my reason for reaching out a bit better.  I know you’ve had several conversations in the past with my colleague Ken Demlow, and had asked him to circle back with you in March to possibly set up a demo of our tools to the City Department heads.  I wanted to let you know that Ken has recently been awarded a fellowship with the city of Cambridge Massachusetts so he’s going to be out for some time.  I’ve stepped in to manage his accounts while he’s away and wanted to check in with you on when you feel might be a good time for a visit to introduce myself and provide that demo.

Feel free to give me a call at any time, I look forward to working with you.","2015-03-16 19:41:05",,,

It's a hot button issue with the county because they haven't done much with it in the past outside of occasional work orders and spreadsheets.  Need solutions for streets, signs, signals, drainage, sanitation, facilities, fleet, permitting (light for things like driveways), drainage, homebase etc.  Pretty much the whole thing..  This is also a partnership with the Deleware County Soil and Water district opportunity.  Have some legacy data but not much and have arch maps.  Want mobile, mostly Ipads in the field but also surfaces, explained the differences.  Have looked at several options (Pubworks, Cityworks, Cartegraph) no relationship with anyone yet so it's an open field.  Looking for someone to come in and say Yes we can do what you need and go from there.

Hi Mike,

I hope this finds you well.  We met briefly at the end of February when my colleague, Marty, and I came down to Garden City to present our software solutions to the group as part of Carol Davidson’s review of permitting solutions.  We’d showed a broad overview of our software’s capabilities including a very brief touch on our capabilities around utilities and a few departments had expressed interest in looking more deeply at those functions which were more specific to them.  

I know Carol’s been hard at work with the Permitting side of things but I wanted to circle back with you to see if you were still curious to see a more in-depth tour of our utilities solutions.  My schedule is fairly flexible so if you have 30-45 minutes free I’d be happy to set up a web demonstration for you.","2015-03-31 20:46:47",,,

He brought VueWorks in only to find out it's clunky and hard to get adoption across other departments. His access to usage stats shows that nobody is using it. Says they started out offering a couple specific modules and bolted on additional modules/functionality in response to customer requests, and he recognizes this as the source of their clunkiness. Asked several questions about work orders/work requests. Water & Sewer stuff is mapped but are utilities outside of the DPW, as is Electric and WWT. Interested in our above-ground modules including Roads, Storm, Signs, Cemetery (they have digital data on several smaller cemeteries and are actively mapping the bigger ones in town now), Parks, Facilities, Fleet. ESRI exists but is managed by a consortium of 7 people, mostly department reps, but also 1 ESRI rep and a board member of the local water works association. Also mentioned that the town has gone through 2-3 Code & Permitting packages in the last few years and haven't found anything they like yet. Asked when we would be out in the area and I mentioned the Summer New England APWA show. Wants a remote demo first in a few weeks and he's going to try to invite as many department reps as possible.

I left a message for you earlier but didn’t want to avoid your email request for additional information, in the event we don’t connect soon.
At Beehive we offer individual infrastructure asset modules, making it possible for a new client to test our software at a very affordable cost. We don’t typically charge one-time fees for deployment/conversion, no required hardware purchases, etc. since we host the data on our servers, and no limitations or upcharges for # of users. We assume much of the original financial risk, counting on you becoming a long-term client.
Module pricing is based on population. A Beehive Wastewater module for a city of 15,030 population would be $5506.00 annually. When numerous modules enter the equation, we discount to an enterprise pricing structure. 
Here’s a short video that provides additional information about our product:

http://beehiveindustries.com/video/overview/overview.html

Please let me know if you have additional questions or would like to schedule a go-to-meeting product demonstration.
Thanks again.

Thank you for reaching out and introducing us to your product.  I reviewed your content online and like the look and feel of your solution, specifically the mobile application.  However, we are currently implementing Infor EAM department wide and integrating with our existing GIS and other programs such as Granite XP, Mission, etc.  This will be our holistic solution for work orders, reporting, asset management, mapping and mobile for the foreseeable future and do not plan on introducing  any new packages.

Again, thank you for the introduction and I will keep your suite of products in mind as we move through our process.

This is an enterprise wide project to help them quantify everything they do.  This project has had some starts and stops over the past two years but they've demoed several systems including Cartegraph, City Works (said was cost prohibitive) PubWorks, and GeoJoe (small player out of Memphis)  Want to start with a couple of modules get adopted and using them and then branch out to other parts of the city.

Kevin had priced this way to get it under the 10K RFP Cap, however, Andy feels like the annual costs will cause a problem too and an RFP is unavoidable.  He's submitted a request for 25K in software for next year's budget, he wont' know if that will be approved until after July 1.  Any RFP would come out after that date but there has been talk of hiring a new GIS coordinator because the city currently has three GIS people on staff for various departments but they each do their own thing.  If the coordinator is hired that might delay things further.  Wants me to check back in July to see how the budget shakes out.  Suggests that if we bid this it might be better to front load dollars to make the annual fee less as opposed to going the opposite route we did before.","2015-04-09 16:21:51",,,

Thank you again for making time for Mike and me on Thursday and for being accommodating on time.  I usually don’t like scheduling meetings so close together so that we’re not rushed but things happen.  I wanted to let you know that I’m getting some info together to give you more on our MS4 capabilities but also wanted to check in to see if you had any follow up questions coming out of our meeting.  We had to run off so I wanted to make sure we weren’t leaving anything hanging.

Mike and I were talking after we left and we were wondering how the ODNR felt about pilot programs.  One thing we’ve done in the past to let people try our software is to provide them a module on a pilot basis, usually for a year to let them use it and see what value it brings.  From what Mike said, our Dams module is fairly easy to deploy; we could implement and maintain it for you for a year for around $10,000.  If, at the end of the pilot, you love it you can renew.  If you don’t, then we part ways.  I just thought I’d throw the idea out there as a fairly low risk option for you.","2015-04-20 21:59:32",,18281-accounts,

Dan, Currently going through the excersize of getting together maping data and was then planning on providing that data to a firm to create and maintain the maps for them.  The other firms will only allow them to add notes to the maps not true asset or workforce management so we have a leg up.  Gave him pricing on Water/Wastewater/Treatment modules which would be 12-15K per year if they bought all four.  They're using grant money for this project so to have a chance we'd need to front load dollars and lower annual licence (other firms are charging 30-40K up front and 2-3 annually).  Wants me to put together a list of reference, give him some overview info, and some options on pricing.

He actually implemented them in PA and it took over 1 year. He also recognizes the clunkiness of their system, and that his guys would never use it. Looking to retire in a couple years so getting a system in place and in practice is a big priority for him. Still has to go out to RFP, but will be relying on John's recommendation. Need to give him a demo, and be sure to demonstrate how we can integrate with ESRI, and also address his concerns over our modular pricing.

Gave them reassurance that we would work with them on pricing as they add modules over time. Asked Kurt and Zach about their data, and it sounds like it's clean, with varying degrees of accuracy. They are both excited about our software and are supporters of technology. Zach described how many of their valves are broken and it's a nightmare trying to shut off water when they have breaks. Will want ESRI integration, and will also need to look into a possible import/integration with MyManager+. Zach didn't seem to remember that part of our core includes Work Orders so need to show him how this works. Will likely start with Water & Storm, and add Wastewater, Sidewalks (ADA compliance), Streetlights, and 311 later. Had a good discussion about creative approaches to budgeting. Looking like this will happen late 2015/early 2016. Kurt gave us a few referrals from neighboring towns.","2015-04-23 11:37:11",,,

I talked to Bill, our Product Development lead, and the first round of our mobile application development (covering streets and sidewalks) is wrapping up and almost ready for deployment.  He’s been waiting to start development on the mobile application for Water/Wastewater.  If you recall we’d planned to partner with you guys to use Salina’s use cases in the build.  That way we could ensure that the application included some of the more robust capabilities you’d asked for.  I’m sure you can understand his frustration in not knowing a timeline for this project because it holds up his development team.  As it stands he’s stuck with two options:

Option 1:             Move forward with the Water/Wastewater Mobile build with another client’s specifications, which may or may not run the risk of leaving Salina with some limited functionality when you do move forward.
Option 2:             Table the Water/Wastewater Mobile build completely and move on to other projects and hope we can get it back on the development schedule in a timely manner once Salina does move forward.

Option 2 really isn’t feasible because we have to keep moving forward to meet the needs of our current clients which leaves us with Option 1.  If you guys are fine with us moving forward on the mobile piece without your input then we can do that, I just wanted to give you a say in the matter.

As for GIS… we were able to team up with the local university to do the GIS work for very cheap. We have that on our website now.

The City of Nederland is in the process of moving to a new map based work order system. We currently utilize a database that was authored in house and contains about 95,000 work orders going back to 1997. We are looking closely at Cityworks at the current time. I have attached a report that was recently produced for a residence in town from our system. Our work order information is related to an address and is then broken into various categories. In Cityworks, we would be linking the work order information to a parcel number from our County mapping system. Can your system do this? We anticipate having to hand enter all of our existing work orders into the system.

I apologize for the missed phone calls, I have been out of the office for a week or so and I am just now catching up with everything. We are still in the process of demoing different packages and waiting to ensure that our budget for this project is accepted by our commissioners. After the line item is accepted (fingers crossed) we will then begin the decision making process in earnest. As far as stopping by during your trip, I would normally say please do but my work schedule is erratic right now and I never know from one day to the next when I will be in the office. The other members of the team are the city manager and finance director. They are currently up to their eyeballs in budget planning and meetings, so I would not be able to guarantee their availability. It may be better that we follow up later. I will contact you after we know the budget is set.

Thanks,
Josh","2015-05-29 16:03:03",,69269-contacts,

looking to extend to valve maintenance

I owe John a list of things back, white paper, tech specs, videos, anything else that may get them excited on the software.

Hi Carmella,

Thanks again for your time yesterday, I hope you agree it was time well spent.  Mike and I have looked over the screen shots you sent over, so far we don’t see anything concerning.  I’m sure we won’t have any trouble replicating the functionality that you need while providing a little simpler user interface.  

One thing that Mike did say is that as we move forward it might be a good idea to have one of your team walk us through a common workflow using your system.  We often find this sort of exercise helps us frame up the process steps you’ll need.

Talked about pricing, Mike quoted between 50-100K for annual licence but implementation will need to be scoped because there may be custom dev needed.  Currently spending between 50-100K on Swims so we're in the ball park.  There are a total of 88 SWCD in the state so we'll probably do a phased implementation beginning with a couple of pilot districts.  Next step is to have a scoping call with dev to determine level of custom work needed and firm up quote of costs.

I have not forgotten you.  I have been unable to get funding to support software such as this even though I am interested.  We are moving very slow with the GIS integration.  It is my hope at some point to bring in a full  picture program that will enable multiple departments to interface with GIS integrated software, but it is too costly for our community at this time.  I am working with some consultants and if we get to the point where I think it is worthwhile to have a demo I will definitely contact you.

He is fairly new on the job and wants to concentrate first on a fleet solution. In his words, “if I fall in love with your fleet module, I have a number of other areas of interest for your modules.” He currently uses a Lotus Notes solution for Fleet and is not happy. 
He saw very little depth in the sample info I sent him and wants to know if we can do life cycle cost analysis and National Association of Fleet Administrators compliant info gathering and reporting. He also seeks to have some input in overall tool parameters.
I stated that I would explore matters internally and see if there is justification for a conference call/demo, which he is very receptive to doing. I also said that fleet is still being built out at Beehive and there may be potential to modify somewhat to his specs.

Lance says their current system is homegrown for work tickets and they do have a GIS/Engineering department but he's not sure what systems they use (esri, cad, etc)  Work tickets and other systems are not currently tied to GIS but he sees the benefit of tying them back to assets.

Marty,
Feel free to contact Rick.. I would say sometime in August and he might have an update as to Finance’s RFP and where the City will be headed at that time.

I thought you’d like an update on how things are coming on the mobile front.  I know I sent you some screenshots a while back that demonstrated some of the Street use cases but I thought you’d like to see some examples of the Water module.  The attached screenshots are taken directly from my iPhone.

Image 1 – This is the first screen you see when you log into the app.  The top two options allow you to report new issues if you happen across something while you’re out in the field.  The items below that are pending work orders assigned to the crew or individual.  Tapping on one of these work orders takes you into the work order

Image 3 and 4 - These are examples of details the crew or individual must notate or collect to complete the work order.  The gray boxes can be tapped on to select the appropriate option or we can also include text boxes for typed notes.

How do you think this looks so far?","2015-07-17 19:36:37",,,

I do believe you have a really good package with Beehive, but we think Accela will meet our immediate needs as well as giving us the ability to scale up in the future.

Let’s shoot for August 4th at 9am.  I’ve attached our one page document outlining what we hope to get from this initial demo.

The City of Bloomington is seeking demonstrations of Work Management/Asset Management solutions for the Maintenance and Engineering Divisions.  The areas of responsibility covered are:
•	Administration
o	Service request intake and routing
o	Online citizen request
•	Storm Water Engineering
o	Storm Water Infrastructure inventory
o	Preventive maintenance, service request, work order, and MS4 compliance
•	Park Maintenance
o	Forestry (diseased tree program)
o	Park and playground infrastructure
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
•	Street Maintenance
o	Right-of-way infrastructure inventory
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
•	Facilities Maintenance
o	Facility infrastructure inventory
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
•	Traffic Maintenance
o	Sign, signal, street light and pavement marking infrastructure
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
Our initial intention is to implement the Work Management functionality for all areas and Asset Management for Storm Water Engineering during the initial phase of implementation.  It is anticipated that Asset Management will be implemented in the other areas in subsequent phases.
For the purposes of an initial demonstration, core functions of the proposed solution should be covered as they were intended to be used out-of-the-box.  Particular areas of interest include:
•	Service Request/Work Order
o	Intake of service request via phone, email, citizen request portal, etc…
o	Complete service request lifecycle work flow
•	Asset inventory
o	Daily asset workflow (pm’s, inspections, service requests)
•	Mobile capabilities (smartphone/tablet/laptop/etc…)
•	GIS integration 
•	Reporting capabilities
o	Dashboards and printed reports","2015-07-20 18:25:28",,,

Right now we are trying to get the existing GIS data to a point that we can hand it over and be put into a long term CMMS system such as Beehive. Probably nothing in this years budget, most likely looking at next year.  

No problem.

He thought out UI was great but the fact that inspection forms are not fully customization was a problem for him because CItyWorks is more flexible in that respect.  If we'd have gotten hold of him sooner we might have had more of a shot but at this point the money has already been earmarked for Cityworks and the WW supervisor who skipped our demo wasn't really that keen on changing tack now.  Rick said he'd pass around our info at an upcoming GIS users conference and might bring us back in for some of the things down the road that Cityworks can't do.","2015-07-28 14:44:08",,35601-accounts,

Allen seemed to have a better understanding of technology and how Beehive could help them, but was either high or crazy.

Says it's focused on W, WW, and Storm, but she admitted that's a day ""out of the office"" for attendees. Consider this one a dead duck.","2015-07-28 17:34:55",,89857-contacts,

Dennis Lutz from Essex had declined the invite to meet with me because he had a prior engagement. Turns out that this was our meeting with Essex Junction. They're in the early stages of consolidating DPW services and there's a possibility that Colchester join in as well. Attendees included:

Jim Jutras, Water Quality Superintendent		
Bernie Fleury, Assistant Chief Operator of Wastewater Treatment Facility (Essex Junction)

Rick Jones, Public Works Superintendent (Essex Junction)
Shannon Lunderville, GIS Coordinator (Essex)

Rick Garey, IT Director (Essex)?

Lots of good questions, and each community seems to have good data. Need to touch base with Jim and get feedback on their post-presentation debrief. We covered lots of ground in 2 hrs so need to scope high-priority modules and put together pricing. Water and WW are both utilities so these modules aren't constrained by capital budgeting.","2015-07-28 17:40:26",,,

Milton is a growing community with MS4 designation. Like other towns in the area, their drinking water comes from Lake Champlain. Roger described a potable water allocation process which involves back-and-forth permitting between the town and the state. In addition to the EPA, the state is becoming more involved in WW and Stormwater management so reporting is a big deal here. Local engineering firm is Aldrich + Elliott and encouraged us to get in touch with them. Need to send a proposal when I get back. Will be a July 1 2016 purchase. Said they can purchase up to $10k without tripping any procurement triggers, but will still need to budget this purchase.","2015-07-28 18:02:19",,,

Lots of politics and workforce issues here, and he's never going to buy any software. He did admit the need for something like Beehive for the next generation, and said that Beehive looked good. Encouraged us to get in touch with his city manager, Joe Colangelo 802-985-5111, as he would drive any software purchases. Paul's mainly in charge of roads and drains and told us some good stories about plowing snow up there - usually doesn't hit mailboxes on purpose. Storm Water/Water Quality, Water, and Wastewater are separate departments so need to follow up with those guys and see if I can them and Joe on a demo to get this one moving.

Will want another demo to take a closer look at how we exchange data with ESRI products. Talked about their CSO - they're under consent orders to address this, and the short-term solution is to increase capacity at the WW treatment facility. Need to determine if this should be managed with both Storm and WW modules, or if everything could be handled within WW only. Also expressed interest in Signs and Streets modules. Need to learn more to see if Work Engine would serve as a tool for tracking potholes and street work, or if it would be better to use our Streets module.
