Hey Mike,

How are things going for you?  Hope all is well.

I ran into Joe a few weeks ago at the NE GIS meeting and he gave me a quick update on Superior, but I figured I would ping you and see how everything is going.  It sounds like you are breaking the town down into quadrants to do the data collection.  Do you know when you are expecting the first quadrant of data to be collected?  I would love to get my hands on that data so we can get that loaded into Beehive and then get it up and running for Larry.

Keep me posted on the timing so I can plan resources here.  I would like to turn this around as quickly as possible once we get the data from you.

Thanks,
Mike

Just spent $15M improving their WW plant (capacity improvements & blow out walls), which was 28 years old.  They've never used grants, but take advantage of bonds when interest rates are competitive. Seems interested in permitting which is currently paper-based - tough to track expirations, which are important to bond enforcement. Subject to annual EPA inspections on thousands of catch basins in the area, and these visits are usually unscheduled. Talked about IBM's presence in the area and their involvement in bringing RO PSI down from 200/300 to 75/85, resulting in a big energy savings and lower maintenance. IBM also got smart meters into homes, and is a huge user of water.  They have 30-50 years of water usage data.  They get their water from Lake Champlain and EJ has 8k residents in 4.6 square miles.

The city has a 311 line where the public can call in a report issues.  Currently the work flow tracking for these is done manually and takes a long time to get to his people.  He'd like to manage it similar to how their public works does where a ticket is logged and can be accessed in the field on their ipads so the crews can just head out to fix something.  Also he'd like to be able to track where equipment is and who it's checked out to as he'd mentioned having that issue with a new lawnmower and weed whacker.  His budget is being cut for next year so a purchase is probably not likely at this point but he is very interested.  Emailed him overview and some preliminary pricing.  He doesn't want to do a full demo now but if he finds the money he'd like to explore it in the future.

Hi Dan,

It was a pleasure to speak with you this morning, thanks again for your time.  Below is a link which will walk you through a very brief overview of the Beehive system.  As I’d mentioned, this is a generic overview but I think it will give you the gist of our capabilities.  If at some point you’d like to take a more specific dive into our Parks module I’d be happy to set up a web demo for you.

Beehive Overview

I also took the liberty of running some pricing numbers for you just so you have it for future reference.  As I’d mentioned we have a pretty straight forward licensing model so there’s typically not any additional install fee.  For a city like Troy, the Parks Module license would run approximately $5,150 per year.

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback on the overview.",ns-activity-8333

Talkative but not really a buyer.  He thinks more about Economic growth and politics than the physical workings of the city.  He did share that some concerns for their public works dept include beach maintenance and rebuilding since they are located on an island and rely heavily on tourism.  The city itself is less than 35 years old so much of it's infrastructure is new.  They have a pressurized sewer system which is monitored regularly.  Since the island is sandy they don't usually have much issue with Storm water since it generally soaks right back up but they have made some improvements recently to manage the flow out to a bay when rains are heavy.  They do perform regular inspection of systems, bridges, and streets but wasn't sure how they logged that work.  

Community is engaged through an online help desk and calls are taken at city hall to report issues.  These are then emailed to the various departments and when the issue is handled they get an email back saying it's done.  These all go to a woman named Gladys who then contacts the initial reporter to let them know it was handled.  Talked about providing better accountability to this system through a work ticketing process and taking some of the load off of Gladys' plate but Josh thought the system worked well and didn't think the mayor would support a more automated system because he liked the personalized touch that Gladys provided and didn't think that accountability or communication was an issue.",

His main priority it in managing the maps and GIS data for the system.  Biggest issue in the region is making sure new buildings are out of the flood plain as city is right along a large river on one side and mountains on the other.  Doesn't find gathering info for public or council to be an issue even though it's a manual process.  Can see where other departments might like to be able to better share info between eachother but he doesn't see it as an issue in his area even though a lot of info comes from them.",

There are several projects within the city to work on beautifying the parks and public spaces including planting more flowers and native grasses, replace old trash cans, build more restrooms, and even building a new park.  Parks team consists of 5 crews and each has it's assigned area and duties.  One of the teams is ""Odd Jobs"" this group goes around and helps the others as necessary or takes care of one of projects.  Work is primarily assigned verbally or via email as things come in from the public but no good way to track things.  Would love to be able to have a system to log incoming requests and assign out work via mobile.  Also would like to be able to have a repository for asset data and historical records.

Not sure if she can do in 2015 budget yet but she's going to see what funds she has.

Hi Shanda,

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with Mike and me this afternoon.  You’ll find a pricing proposal attached which outlines the cost associated with our Parks module.  

As I’d mentioned on the phone, we take a different approach to pricing than many software solutions out there.  Rather than charging a large up front installation cost and ongoing license fees we provide a flat-fee year to year license model with no additional costs for installation.  The price you pay to license the software in year one, is the same as license costs for year five.  We’re very proud of the fact that we have a 100% annual renewal rate so we’re confident that if you choose to partner with Beehive it will be a long and beneficial relationship.

Let me know if you have any questions on this or any of the information that was shared in our demo today.",

Very proud of how the city has grown and how much they have invested in their parks and public space.  Each park has a crew leader who is responsible for inspection, maintenance, etc and if help is needed a Supervisor or additional crew is called in.  Currently work is dolled out via phone and text to the various crews.  Rick is trying to improve this process by getting mobile phones and using email but he knows it's not perfect.  Talked about what beehive can do and he was very impressed.  The city is currently expanding its parks and public spaces including several miles of bike and walking trails which will connect to surrounding communities.  Rick asked about using reporting and GIS data to benchmark with the other communities.  Currently reporting is very hard to detail and being able to share info and compare with others would be helpful.  Certainly if those other communities are gathering the same type of data (and also using beehive) they could easily compare notes and maintain records on maintenance of those shared trails.  

Gave Rick a quote of 10K for the parks module, he's interested but feels he'd have a hard time getting approval from the Council however, if Public Works got on board he'd have more leverage.  Public Works has been working on projects to provide more efficiency and accountability in tracking work including installing GPS tracking in many of their trucks.  Told him we could help them use that data more effectively.  He's going to talk to ""Sam"" in public works to see if he'd like to sit in on a demo and we'll get back together.",ns-activity-9537

Otherwise he occasionally hires part time people but his department is more responsible for inspecting equipment and light maintenance.  The rest (mowing, sidewalks, planting, etc) is handled by Public Works.  If he sees something that needs to be done he tells public works and he has to trust that they'll do it because they don't give him feedback.  They inspect equipment quarterly and get regular funds to upgrade parks and equipment but Mike really isn't a pusher on improvements.  He's of the mind set that what they do works for their very limited responsibilities and if they city ever grows maybe they'll get more money from the tax base.  Otherwise it is what it is.

I really appreciate it.  As we discussed, I’ll reach back out in about 6 months as you begin to work on budgets.  In the meantime, I’ve included a link that you can visit at your convenience to learn more about our infrastructure management software.  

Also, I know that Edenton is a small town, but given that we work almost exclusively small communities, we are priced much differently than you may have seen.  
•	For example, you could get a W, WW, or Streets module for a cost of $3,000 for the first year and only $2,000/year going forward.  This would allow you to create work histories for specific pieces of infrastructure and take advantage of any GIS data you have, or use ours at no additional charge.  

As I mentioned, I’ll reach out in 6 months, but let me know if you have any questions or would like to take a closer look at the software and how it performs.  

Thanks, again - Brent

The community dev piece is his baby, working with the community to address their issues and allocate funds to community driven projects.  Brent currently uses Iworks which he loves because it's inexpensive and very easy to use.  However, the new city financial director (was previously at Pittsburg KS) is driving a project with public works to switch to Incode which brent says is more expensive and much more complicated.  His comment was that it's Built from the top down as in more accounting admin based vs ground up to be easy to use for the people in the field.  Might be able to attack this through PW and City Manager but it sounds like it's pretty well set in stone with the CW being a big fan of Incode.",

They're big Esri users and have Esri's mobile technology and getting ready to roll that out.  His main issue with Esri is that it doesn't support related tables so when info is updated it doesn't feed across.  Also doesn't think that Archpad is great for tracking and logging inspections and can't associate other records like work orders, pictures, videos etc.  They have an enterprise licence so no per-seat cost.

The city is in the process of contracting with City Works which is similar to us in that it can consume the esri data and make it more usable and accessible.  He likes what we have to offer but he prefers city works because the annual cost is low (didn't provide me with upfront costs), it's an onprem solution which he prefers, and it's been around a lot longer than us.  There's a comfort level for him in that he ""knows they'll be around in 15 years"".  He is willing to look at our module videos and provide feedback though and isn't against dropping our name if anyone asks.  He did say that the City of Atchison was recently asking for recommendations on solutions so he'd seen our name on that list.  Need to find out who's driving that project.",

Brian was intrigued by the time tracking tab.  FEMA reimbursed was brought up by Brian.  Police chief and street superintendent just joined.  Brian has a hard stop at 10:00.  Mike went over the GIS for Greg.  We brought the article with Ozarks that brought GIS alive.  Asking questions about breaking pipe, operational perspective.  Just to new status, history doesn't go away.  Map will behave like a life cycle...react to operational work flow. Brian had to leave, he told Greg to feel comfortable with the system and how it can intergrated into what they are currently using now.  Talking about Code Enforcement.  Code Enforcement is not the same price as the other modules.  $3,600...they like it.  They asked if they can put their violations that can match to their city...answer is yes.  Open violation by age.  They had no questions, they say it looked good.  Keith asked about permission for Brian to see all data in Beehive.  Operational access for Brian.

Rachel is super chatty and very candid about how the city is run and the issues she sees.  The city is broke and has had to seek grant funding for many of the improvements they've been putting in place.  Most of that funding has gone to streets in low and moderate income areas.  They also have issues with floodplanes and stormwater and have been attempting to get some TIF funding to develop and pave a new area and run water and wastewater which will include some senior living facilities and an industrial park.  

She was very excited about what we do and how we can work with the GIS person and various departments to improve communication and track information across departments.  She feels like there is a lot of ego in play with GIS and public works/water in particular.  When it comes to contractors and permitting there's not a lot of accountability on collecting fees or the work provided so she feels that money is hemorrhaging out of the city.  She also doesn't have the best relationship with the city manager so she's hesitant to bring this project to him herself but her brother in law works in utilities and is the current ""golden boy"" so she'd like to bring this to him to present as an option to the CM.  THere is no PW director at this time.  She asked for information such as our menu of services, video, any suggestions on funding options to pay for it, etc.  She's excited about the prospect but would have to work hard and manage a few different channels to get it off the ground.",ns-activity-13121

They have a very aging infrustructure in streets, water/wastewater, etc and have troubles getting information to staff as far as what they're getting into when they go out on a job.  For example, just locating valves can be a challenge.  Not a lot of things available digitally, they do have a GIS department (part of IT) who maintains their maps and schematics but requests have to be placed to get information which can take time.  The city currently has City Works but not everyone likes it and they haven't really spent much time exploring it's capabilities because some think it's complicated.  Just because the city has it though doesn't mean that PW can't use something else if another system is better.  Working on scheduling demo times.",

They do have a centralized system where they track maintenance/work orders on a GIS basis.  Activities are tied to individual assets such as pipes valves, etc.  Records are maintained by a clerk in the dept, no one else knows how or wants to know how to add that info.  They just bring in a hand written report when an action is taken and hand it off to her to input.  Budget cycle runs june to may and has been approved for next year.  Louisiana does not have a standardized budget cycle for cities some run Jan-Dec others run differently.

Challenges: trying to increase the regularity of maintenance and replace older infrastructure.  Information is currently kept in various places so reporting can often be a hassle.  Use Incode for financials/work order/ etc and so far it's been working well for them and city admin is working with incode to improve capabilities.  Also use Esri tools for mapping and are in the process of upgrading to the mobile capabilities for access to maps in the field,  One think he wishes he had was better access to data and tracking for reporting but he believes that will come as part of the system upgrades they already have planned.

No show, so the following email went out to Heather. 

Hi Heather, Happy Holidays!

I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Zach Stivrins and I am focused on our Pacific Coast clients at Beehive. I had heard the Seal Beach story pop up a few times this summer, so last week I had a call with Sean Crumby. Sean was excited about the combination of Permitting with Asset/Infrastructure Management, and specified that is exactly what the City of Seal Beach is looking to implement. 

Sean gave me instructions to reach out to Luis, so far I haven’t had any luck with the busy holiday timing. If you have further information that may help revive the project or if you have any specifics needs from me at this time I would be more than happy to connect the dots. 

Have a great holiday season, and I wish the best for the City of Seal Beach! I hope to chat soon,",

Follow up with him towards the end of the week if we dont hear back. Copying most recent $ below. 

Jason, thanks for the rapid reply and the well wishes! The Beehive team is excited to recharge the batteries over the coming weeks and look forward to 2015.

List price for Junction City is $3,600 per module. This is based on a population of 5,600 in the City. We price on population because we have an unlimited user license, also, per your questions, all training is included in this annual license. 

We do have a Water Treatment Module. Which reminds me, I need to update my “Menu”!

Better news still, is that with 4 or more modules we apply a 15% discount across the board. This results in a per module cost of $3,060 for Junction City. Or, with the 5 modules listed below, $15,300/year. 

In regards to your last question, our implementation time frame is 6-weeks. The “phasing” of these rollouts is very common, ie. Wastewater and Wastewater Treatment first, Water and Water Treatment second, followed by Storm, or in any order that takes precedence.  We don’t have a “phased” discount per se due to the 15% discount applied to the contracting of 4+ modules. 

I hope this answers all of your questions! If not, feel free to send another email or give me a call. I would also be happy to schedule a demonstration of the technology so that you can get a better feel for it as you make your decision. I’m sure you and your team have some vacation time upcoming, but let me know how you would like to proceed and I will make it happen.",

Also use Esri have an enterprise license.  CPI projects include the usual, fix streets, replace aging infrastructure in water/wastewater, they're also working on a down town revitalization.  According to sherry city works works really well for work orders and everyone's happy with it however, reporting is an issue because it's hard to get information out.  She and the it department are working on creating a backend reporting structure using SQL and crystal reports in hopes of aleviating some of those issues.  She thinks that will fix it but it's going to be hard to get department heads to use because most lay people aren't comfortable with those quiries.  Our reporting is already baked in and simple for anyone to use and would give them the reporting capabilities they need.  

I'm not going to get anywhere with her until the cityworks contract comes up for renewal.  Continue working lower channels to drive need and then filter up to her for the final project push.",

Use an access file to manage work orders and really don't track inventory.  There are distributors in the region and they just call whenever they need something.  Don't have much for mappng data right now but the previous pw director came out of retirement to help them create some maps with Esri tools.  Guys in field don't use mobile.  Hasn't been asked for reports from council yet (""thank god"") but if he was he admitted he'd have a hard time reporting on it.

One thing that piqued his interest was asset management, one of their contractors has been trying to get them to use a tool that he likes but Jason thinks it's too complicated and hasn't worked for them.  He'd like to be able to track the lifespan, composition, and materials of things like wells, waterlines etc.

Wants to do a demo but isn't sure when he'll have time right now because of some other projects.  Wants to check his schedule and get something on the calendar within the next couple of weeks.  Wants to keep in touch.",

That’s understandable, most smaller cities don’t have a dedicated planner or GIS person on staff.  But then, for what we provide you don’t actually need one.  As part of deployment we’ll take what information you do have (cad drawings, asbuilts, excel files, even the institutional knowledge stored in the heads of city employees) to build out mapping layers for you.  From there it’s a very simple thing to Geoedit pipe placements, add or remove features, etc.

The power of our solution rests in the combination of mapping, asset, and workforce management.  It’s one thing to know where a pipe is, it’s another to know what it’s made of, how old it is, what kind of inspections or repairs have been done to it, and what kind of documentation (reports, videos, pictures) you have on it.  Our goal is to provide a one-stop shop for all of your data so that it’s accessible, reportable, and above all actionable.  If you have a specific section of town where you’re constantly dealing with older pipes bursting, it helps to have concrete data to bring to council if you hope to get funds into the CIP to improve that area.

Let me know if you or the city’s public works director have any questions.  Like I mentioned previously, a high level demo would only take about 30 minutes so there’s not much commitment if you’re curious about what we do.

Cheryl",

I realize Ramseur is going through several major personnel changes, which can make any discussion around asset management seem ill-timed.  However, I actually think you would find this to be a perfect time to consider something to help organization all of your information before any more change occurs to help ensure a smooth transition.  As I mentioned on the message, Beehive helps small towns manage their infrastructure assets. Specifically, Beehive helps those towns in three ways:

•	Provides an easy to use work order system that allows tracking and transparency
•	Makes their current GIS more accessible and easier to use for the entire team (or can provide mapping, if necessary)
•	Provides a central location to store documents in various formats, which can be tied to features on a specific point on a map

Further, we specialize in working with smaller communities, so we understand that you have to do more with less, both in terms of employees and money. I am hoping we can have a short conversation so I can learn about the specifics of Ramseur as well as provide you details of how other small towns are using Beehive. Please let me know if you would like to get something on the calendar in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks - Brent",

Hey Zack, 
I really liked your product. I’ve discussed it with the accountant and I do believe I am at least going to get collections and distribution packages.

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner, we’ve been getting hammered with snow up here in Lincoln and I was snowed in on Monday and put behind.

I’ve had our Product Manager look over the info you sent me and he agrees that it is a pretty intense process compared to most cities, however, our model is pretty flexible so making a few changes is just a matter of time to implement.  What I might recommend is that we show you where the solution is now as it relates to your outline below.  Then we can scope out any tweaks you’ll need us to make.  From there, we can put together a timeline and quote based on the level of effort.  That should give you a solid idea of whether or not Beehive is something you want to pursue for your team.

I’m going to be in Salina next Thursday (the 12th) to give a broad overview presentation to Public Works and the other department heads.  Keith Ganzenmuller may have forwarded you the invite.  We won’t be covering the Permitting capabilities specifically in this demonstration but you’ll get the gist of the wider solution and we could look at other days/times to focus specifically on your needs.",

Communities that want to start with water/wastewater is all well and good but if they want to add streets or storm she doesn't feel like they'd want to spend another 3600 on each, it prices them out of the market.  Might be open to looking at a scenario where we front load dollars.  They have about 20 small cities in their cooperative from 1200 to 20,000 population, but work with up to 50 communities at the moment and looking to add up to 10 more per year.  Also work wit 4 or 5 water/sewer districts.  She's really looking for a solution which can feasibly work accross the board because they don't want to have to deal with multiple asset management systems across all these different communities.  They've looked at all the main players, Lucity, CityWorks, Inforce, Excella.  Wouldn't tell me who the front runner is but said she did find one that worked out to be cheaper over 3-5 years with a per seat model because the vast majority of cities they work with would only need one or two licences.

Was also conserned with the fact that we don't have the mobile app out (explained the difference of mobile with a laptop vs mobile on an IPAD, iPad/android is the only limitation).  Also thought Marty's description of the Esri integration was way more complicated than what other's have provided.  Take a look at creative cost solutions.",

I wanted to let you know that Ken has recently been awarded a fellowship with the city of Cambridge Massachusetts so he’s going to be out for some time.  I’ve stepped in to manage his accounts while he’s away and wanted to check in with you on when you feel might be a good time for a visit to introduce myself and provide that demo.

Happy spring!  I tried calling your office but Andrea said you were out for training the next few days.  I just wanted to touch base with you quickly to follow up on any next steps Garden City would be taking in your software review.  When we were onsite last month there was some talk about providing some more individualized demos for the various departments to cover their specific modules as well as possibly arraigning some more references to talk about the planning piece.

Frank's been here for 4 1/2 years and sees the value of asset/infrastructure mgmt software. He brought VueWorks in only to find out it's clunky and hard to get adoption across other departments. His access to usage stats shows that nobody is using it. Says they started out offering a couple specific modules and bolted on additional modules/functionality in response to customer requests, and he recognizes this as the source of their clunkiness. Asked several questions about work orders/work requests. Water & Sewer stuff is mapped but are utilities outside of the DPW, as is Electric and WWT. Interested in our above-ground modules including Roads, Storm, Signs, Cemetery (they have digital data on several smaller cemeteries and are actively mapping the bigger ones in town now), Parks, Facilities, Fleet. ESRI exists but is managed by a consortium of 7 people, mostly department reps, but also 1 ESRI rep and a board member of the local water works association. Also mentioned that the town has gone through 2-3 Code & Permitting packages in the last few years and haven't found anything they like yet. Asked when we would be out in the area and I mentioned the Summer New England APWA show. Wants a remote demo first in a few weeks and he's going to try to invite as many department reps as possible. Also wants pricing.",

He's submitted a request for 25K in software for next year's budget, he wont' know if that will be approved until after July 1.  Any RFP would come out after that date but there has been talk of hiring a new GIS coordinator because the city currently has three GIS people on staff for various departments but they each do their own thing.  If the coordinator is hired that might delay things further.  Wants me to check back in July to see how the budget shakes out.

Looking to retire in a couple years so getting a system in place and in practice is a big priority for him. Still has to go out to RFP, but will be relying on John's recommendation. Need to give him a demo, and be sure to demonstrate how we can integrate with ESRI, and also address his concerns over our modular pricing. Has the money budgeted so will move quickly once he soon releases the RFP.",

Gave them reassurance that we would work with them on pricing as they add modules over time. Asked Kurt and Zach about their data, and it sounds like it's clean, with varying degrees of accuracy. They are both excited about our software and are supporters of technology. Zach described how many of their valves are broken and it's a nightmare trying to shut off water when they have breaks. Will want ESRI integration, and will also need to look into a possible import/integration with MyManager+. Zach didn't seem to remember that part of our core includes Work Orders so need to show him how this works. Will likely start with Water & Storm, and add Wastewater, Sidewalks (ADA compliance), Streetlights, and 311 later. Had a good discussion about creative approaches to budgeting. Looking like this will happen late 2015/early 2016. Kurt gave us a few referrals from neighboring towns.",

Gave him pricing on Water/Wastewater/Treatment modules which would be 12-15K per year if they bought all four.

I talked to Bill, our Product Development lead, and the first round of our mobile application development (covering streets and sidewalks) is wrapping up and almost ready for deployment.  He’s been waiting to start development on the mobile application for Water/Wastewater.  If you recall we’d planned to partner with you guys to use Salina’s use cases in the build.  That way we could ensure that the application included some of the more robust capabilities you’d asked for.  I’m sure you can understand his frustration in not knowing a timeline for this project because it holds up his development team.  As it stands he’s stuck with two options:

Option 1:             Move forward with the Water/Wastewater Mobile build with another client’s specifications, which may or may not run the risk of leaving Salina with some limited functionality when you do move forward.
Option 2:             Table the Water/Wastewater Mobile build completely and move on to other projects and hope we can get it back on the development schedule in a timely manner once Salina does move forward.

Option 2 really isn’t feasible because we have to keep moving forward to meet the needs of our current clients which leaves us with Option 1.  If you guys are fine with us moving forward on the mobile piece without your input then we can do that, I just wanted to give you a say in the matter.

Says they're also looking for presenters. $400 to join as a corporate member. Also encouraged me to continue contacting other MEUA members and leverage our relationship with Wellsville to get their attention. Not attending the APPA Conference in Minneapolis, but says it would be worth getting in touch with Andy McMahan from Messina, who now sits on that board.",

I apologize for the missed phone calls, I have been out of the office for a week or so and I am just now catching up with everything. We are still in the process of demoing different packages and waiting to ensure that our budget for this project is accepted by our commissioners. After the line item is accepted (fingers crossed) we will then begin the decision making process in earnest. As far as stopping by during your trip, I would normally say please do but my work schedule is erratic right now and I never know from one day to the next when I will be in the office. The other members of the team are the city manager and finance director. They are currently up to their eyeballs in budget planning and meetings, so I would not be able to guarantee their availability. It may be better that we follow up later. I will contact you after we know the budget is set.

Thanks,
Josh",ns-activity-30589

pilot w/ city works
pilot has gone pretty well
other parts of city are looking to jump on board
initial pilot with fire hydrant maintenance system
looking to extend to valve maintenance
city proper has began pilot on growth management/permitting

has asked to send white paper/tech specs on software
john says he will put to his project team and see what they like

I owe John a list of things back, white paper, tech specs, videos, anything else that may get them excited on the software.

We specifically talked about some of the niche use cases we could look at and the possibility of a pilot in one of those areas. That got him thinking, so that may be an avenue to look into.",

Mike suggests at some point we have her team walk us through a common workflow task just to help us frame things up.


Hi Carmella,

Thanks again for your time yesterday, I hope you agree it was time well spent.  Mike and I have looked over the screen shots you sent over, so far we don’t see anything concerning.  I’m sure we won’t have any trouble replicating the functionality that you need while providing a little simpler user interface.  

One thing that Mike did say is that as we move forward it might be a good idea to have one of your team walk us through a common workflow using your system.  We often find this sort of exercise helps us frame up the process steps you’ll need.

Talked more about the state's needs.  Will need time tracking such as creating a time sheet, capabilities around Education & Outreach, as well as grant management.  Talked about pricing, Mike quoted between 50-100K for annual licence but implementation will need to be scoped because there may be custom dev needed.  Currently spending between 50-100K on Swims so we're in the ball park.  There are a total of 88 SWCD in the state so we'll probably do a phased implementation beginning with a couple of pilot districts.  Next step is to have a scoping call with dev to determine level of custom work needed and firm up quote of costs.  Martin needs to ask some questions at the state level to make sure we don't trip any RFP triggers by going through the scoping excersize, once he knows for sure we'll get something on the calendar.",

I have not forgotten you.  I have been unable to get funding to support software such as this even though I am interested.  We are moving very slow with the GIS integration.  It is my hope at some point to bring in a full  picture program that will enable multiple departments to interface with GIS integrated software, but it is too costly for our community at this time.  I am working with some consultants and if we get to the point where I think it is worthwhile to have a demo I will definitely contact you.

Lance says their current system is homegrown for work tickets and they do have a GIS/Engineering department but he's not sure what systems they use (esri, cad, etc)  Work tickets and other systems are not currently tied to GIS but he sees the benefit of tying them back to assets. Is open to a demo to see what's out there but the summer's a busy time of year, wanted me to check back in the fall when things are quieter and they may have more of a drive to get something in.",

I thought you’d like an update on how things are coming on the mobile front.  I know I sent you some screenshots a while back that demonstrated some of the Street use cases but I thought you’d like to see some examples of the Water module.  The attached screenshots are taken directly from my iPhone.

Image 1 – This is the first screen you see when you log into the app.  The top two options allow you to report new issues if you happen across something while you’re out in the field.  The items below that are pending work orders assigned to the crew or individual.  Tapping on one of these work orders takes you into the work order

Image 3 and 4 - These are examples of details the crew or individual must notate or collect to complete the work order.  The gray boxes can be tapped on to select the appropriate option or we can also include text boxes for typed notes.

How do you think this looks so far?",

See email below.

Let’s shoot for August 4th at 9am.  I’ve attached our one page document outlining what we hope to get from this initial demo.

The City of Bloomington is seeking demonstrations of Work Management/Asset Management solutions for the Maintenance and Engineering Divisions.  The areas of responsibility covered are:
•	Administration
o	Service request intake and routing
o	Online citizen request
•	Storm Water Engineering
o	Storm Water Infrastructure inventory
o	Preventive maintenance, service request, work order, and MS4 compliance
•	Park Maintenance
o	Forestry (diseased tree program)
o	Park and playground infrastructure
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
•	Street Maintenance
o	Right-of-way infrastructure inventory
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
•	Facilities Maintenance
o	Facility infrastructure inventory
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
•	Traffic Maintenance
o	Sign, signal, street light and pavement marking infrastructure
o	Preventive maintenance, service request and work order
Our initial intention is to implement the Work Management functionality for all areas and Asset Management for Storm Water Engineering during the initial phase of implementation.  It is anticipated that Asset Management will be implemented in the other areas in subsequent phases.
For the purposes of an initial demonstration, core functions of the proposed solution should be covered as they were intended to be used out-of-the-box.  Particular areas of interest include:
•	Service Request/Work Order
o	Intake of service request via phone, email, citizen request portal, etc…
o	Complete service request lifecycle work flow
•	Asset inventory
o	Daily asset workflow (pm’s, inspections, service requests)
•	Mobile capabilities (smartphone/tablet/laptop/etc…)
•	GIS integration 
•	Reporting capabilities
o	Dashboards and printed reports",

Right now we are trying to get the existing GIS data to a point that we can hand it over and be put into a long term CMMS system such as Beehive. Probably nothing in this years budget, most likely looking at next year.

Milton is a growing community with MS4 designation. Like other towns in the area, their drinking water comes from Lake Champlain. Roger described a potable water allocation process which involves back-and-forth permitting between the town and the state. In addition to the EPA, the state is becoming more involved in WW and Stormwater management so reporting is a big deal here.
